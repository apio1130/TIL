# Spring-tx 관련 메모
spring-tx 6.0 버전부터 CGLIB Proxy 에서 protected 메서드에 대한 `@Transactional` 을 허용하게 변경됨.

## 참고 - spring 코드

> spring-tx-6.x 의 ProxyTransactionManagementConfiguration.
> ```java
> // ... 생략 ...
> public class ProxyTransactionManagementConfiguration extends AbstractTransactionManagementConfiguration {
> // ... 생략 ...
> 
> 	@Bean
> 	@Role(BeanDefinition.ROLE_INFRASTRUCTURE)
> 	public TransactionAttributeSource transactionAttributeSource() {
> 		// Accept protected @Transactional methods on CGLIB proxies, as of 6.0.
> 		return new AnnotationTransactionAttributeSource(false);
> 	}
> 
> // ... 생략 ...
> }
> ```

## 참고 - spring.io docs
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/annotations.html#transaction-declarative-annotations-method-visibility

> Method visibility and @Transactional in proxy mode  
> The @Transactional annotation is typically used on methods with public visibility. As of 6.0, protected or package-visible methods can also be made transactional for class-based proxies by default. Note that transactional methods in interface-based proxies must always be public and defined in the proxied interface. For both kinds of proxies, only external method calls coming in through the proxy are intercepted.
> 
> If you prefer consistent treatment of method visibility across the different kinds of proxies (which was the default up until 5.3), consider specifying publicMethodsOnly:  
> 
> ``` java
> /**
>  * Register a custom AnnotationTransactionAttributeSource with the
>  * publicMethodsOnly flag set to true to consistently ignore non-public methods.
>  * @see ProxyTransactionManagementConfiguration#transactionAttributeSource()
>  */
> @Bean
> TransactionAttributeSource transactionAttributeSource() {
> 	return new AnnotationTransactionAttributeSource(true);
> }
> ```
> 
> The Spring TestContext Framework supports non-private @Transactional test methods by default as well. See Transaction Management in the testing chapter for examples.
